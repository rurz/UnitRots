# `UnitRots`

## Unitary rotation of polychromatic images and analysis of Gibbs-type oscillations

___

This is a support repository for the upcoming research article on polychromatic images using unitary rotations on the _su(2)_ algebra

The repository contains two scripts that perform the rotation of mono- and polychromatic images. `scripts/RotaMono.jl` and `scripts/RotaPoly.jl` admits square PNG images.

**Caveats**: Images at almost size _N = 68_ are possible, this is because the binomial involved in the calculation of the Kravchuk matrices go overflow for greater combination values > {67, 30}
